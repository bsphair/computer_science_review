# Architecture

## Service Mesh
* An inter-service communication infrastructure
* A given Microservice wonâ€™t directly communicate with the other microservices
* Rather all service-to-service communications will take places on-top of a software component called service mesh (or side-car proxy)
* Service Mesh provides built-in support for some network functions such as resiliency, service discovery etc.
* Therefore, service developers can focus more on the business logic while most of the work related to network communication is offloaded to the service mesh
