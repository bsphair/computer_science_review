## Arrays vs Linked Lists
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Array</th>
    <th>Linked List</th>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <th>
      Insertions/Deletions are inefficient as elements are usually shifted
    </th>
    <th>
      Intertions/Deletions are efficient as no shifting is required
    </th>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <th>
      Random access
    </th>
    <th>
      No random access
    </th>
  </tr>
</table>

## Advantages Over Arrays

* Dynamic size
* Ease of insertion/deletion

## Disadvantages 

* No random access
