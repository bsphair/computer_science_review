# Front End Security

## Cross-ste scripting (XSS)
* A security exploit which allows an attacker to inject into a website malicious client-side code
* Attacks succeed if the Web app does not employ enough validation or encoding
* User's browser cannot detect the malicious script is untrustworthy, and so gives it access to any cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive site-specific information, or lets the malicious script rewrite the HTML content
* Attackes occur when
  1. data enters a Web app through an untrusted source (most often a Web request) or
  1. dynamic content is sent to a Web user without being validated for malicious content
